About:
This is Andrew Nagle and Daniel Kim's CRUD App.  We created this together.  

If you haven't created an account or haven't logged in, you can still look at all the reviews that other people have created already by navigating to the top of the page.  If there is a television show or a movie that you don't see on our review app, you can create an account and log in to create a new thread for that movie or show.

We added some great features like a star rating and you can also add a youtube clip that has to do with your show or movie.  This is a great tool because it can give other viewers a glimpse of what your movie or show could be like. Another great feature we allowed was to allow viewers to modify or edit the details of the movie or the show that may better describe or fit the movie or show.  

Technologies:
-We used several node.js packages, such as express/bodyparser/videojs/granimjs/method-override/ and others, to create a fullstack web application. To create our style.css page we used gulp, this way all we had to do was update our style.less page and hit save and the new changes would be applied. 

-We also utilized a database for the first time as well by using mongoose and MONGODB.

-We both utilized GIT/GITHUB to simulataneously work on this project remotely.

Problems/Improvements:
We didn't have any problems, but we did have other improvements we wanted to add.

-We could have made animated transitions to elevate the user experience but we didnt feel that it was necessary for an MVP.

-Another thing we could have added was add micro animations within the pages that could have given the user more interactability and also increase the user experience as well.

-Having a more thoughtout frame is something we could have worked on more but overall to get the server functioning, we believe what we have is fine but not perfect or fully optimized.

-If we were to spend more time, we would like to add a user page that can show all of the users reviews and shows/movies that they have contributed to and maybe a little info about themselves and a messaging function as well.
